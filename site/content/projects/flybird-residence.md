description = "<p>Flybird, such a nice journey!</p><p>Originally an old condo, with no furniture, broken bathroom, small windows, no lights, nothing...</p><p>From the first moment I felt, this condo needs decent size windows, large bathroom, and have space for a walk in closet. Why not turn an old dirty condo to a 5 star hotel or even more as finally this condo got a fully functional kitchen, an Alexa Smart System with voice controlled lights, voice controlled curtain, Tv and Aircon.</p><p>During the construction, we changed the complete plumbing system, installed new electric wires, smart switches and plenty of light sources. We lifted up the ceiling and built a false gypsum ceiling with LED lights, and to bring as much light to the bedroom we decided to use a glass sliding door in between the bathroom and bedroom.</p><p>To the entrance we installed design lights, the condo got an office corner and a full size walk in closet.</p><p></p>"
