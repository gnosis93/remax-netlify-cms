description = "<p>Golden Pattaya Condo, a high floor sea view condo in Na Kluea, which offers plenty of lights. As the original condo had old style furniture and yellow walls, we decided to completely change the style and the colors. </p><p>One big mistake this unit originally had was a wall which covers the sea view when you step in the condo. While we were working on the 3D model of this condo, we realized, the wall must be cut, and let more light to the kitchen area, but at the same time, if we remove the wall completely, we cant install a nice size office table, so finally we cut half of the wall and modified the side of the wall to a fancy shelf.</p><p>As in many of our projects, we installed new kitchen with Hafele equipments, a nice romantic dining area and also a relaxing armchair facing to the Tv. We also changed the headboard of the bed, and installed a 4 meter wide leather headboard, which we manufacture in our factory.</p><p>We installed plenty of spot lights to feel the space bright at night time as originally this condo was dark, as well as installed trendy chandelier to the main living area as well as the balcony. </p>"
