description = "<p>After finishing our first View Talay Project, we decided to renovate one more unit, but this time we selected a high floor sea view unit. We also decided to manufacture a bed, which has light colors and fits to the interior. As it's seen on the images, we installed central aircon system, which uses the space between the kitchen and the living room. We changed the ceiling of the kitchen and on top of the kitchen cabinet, we installed extra storage.</p><p>This project got plenty of light sources, design lights and ceiling lights, the balcony got hard wood flooring and a small romantic dining set.</p><p>The bathroom originally was really small, so we moved the bathroom wall and lifted up the ceiling, getting a decent size bathroom with a luxury style. </p>"
